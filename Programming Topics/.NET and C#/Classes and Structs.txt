You can call a constructor from another constructor within the same class, using "this":

// ctor 1 has a single parameter
public Employee(int annualSalary)
{
    Salary = annualSalary;
}

// ctor 2 just calls ctor 1
public Employee(int weeklySalary, int numberOfWeeks)
    : this(weeklySalary * numberOfWeeks)
{
}
